# Overview of the analysis:
## The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
Determine the number of retiring employees and their current titles and identify eligible employees to participate in a mentorship program. 

# Results:
## There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. (6 pt)
The top title that employees set to retire in the company are Senior Engineer, followed by Senior Staff and Engineer. It should be the top priority for HR to start hiring for those titles or look to keep track of employees set to reach Senior Engineer. HR should take note of employees who are eligible for the mentorship program, and if the employee is looking for mentorship in the same department or another department, that could hint at a change in career for the employee. 

# Summary:
## The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
Creating tables to store employee information ready to retire will create job openings that could be filled internally and externally. A mentorship program is an excellent initiative for HR departments to start scouting for those job openings internally whether the employee wishes to make an up word move or change of department.
